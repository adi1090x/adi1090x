<h1 align="center">Why am I charging for FOSS stuff?</h1>

A lot of people complain about why I'm charging for stuff that are **FOSS**. Simple and straightforward answer, **`I'm Not`**.

I'm charging for the **time, work and efforts** I put in creating those amazing stuff **`for you`**.

_`Why though?`_ I've not asked you to do that. `Correct, You've not`. But Some people did ask for that. And **that paid stuff is not for you**, It's for them who have asked for that.

But as a person who loves `ricing`, I share those things with you, So you can take _inspiration_ and try to rice on your own, So that you can **learn**. Not because I want an audience to buy my stuff or advertising on those particular [platforms](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/). I don't even put any **`links`** or comments **`GO, grab the files from here and there`**, **`Check my patreon page`** and shit. I don't care. People who really need it will buy it. People who have asked for that, will buy that.

And all the money I get from this, Will eventually be invested in a **Free and Open Source Project, [Archcraft](https://archcraft.io/)**. Which I've created and maintain all alone.

### Also, Why should I not charge?

Let me tell you why... I'm an `Openbox WM` guy, I'm using it for 5 years till date. I don't use many WMs. But I've configured many WMs for you people *as you've asked me* to do that, **`Kind of demanded`**. Like do this and do that. I've still done that for free (_Archcraft has 8 free WMs, Each of them amazingly configured to provide you a DE like experience_).

Now I want you to imagine the work I have to put here for your **`Requested WM`**.

- Find a window manager.
- Read all of its `man pages`, wasting hours understanding how things work.
- Write the config file **from scratch**, step by step. Keeping everything in mind according to a user, what's the most popular keybinding pattern, windows rules for application most user use, etc etc.
- Find add-on programs to make the whole WM usable. **`statusbar`**, **`application launcher`**, **`powermenus`**, **`applets`**, **`notification daemon`**, **`wallpaper setter`**, **`polkit agents`**, **`terminals`**, **`CLI programs`**, and many other things.
- Read the `man pages` for **each utility** and write configuration files for each of them, again from scratch.
- **Style** each of those programs, How they should look and work.
- **Writing scripts** for each program so that they can ***work differently*** on each WM, So setting up multiple WMs does not mess with other WM's style.
- Finding / creating a good **`color-scheme`**.
- Use that color-scheme to `style all desktop elements` (terminal, bar, menus, notifications)
- Find / create `gtk themes` to match with that color-scheme and other desktop elements.
- Find the correct `icon pack` so it'll fit with the overall appearance of the desktop.
- Find amazing `wallpapers`, and then edit them with that color-scheme.
- Think every small detail accurately, where should be the `statusbar` placed, how big the `menu` should be, what kind of `fonts` should look good, what should be `ideal font size`, which `elements` are most needed on the bar, where should `notifications` display, what should be the `priority` for each level of notifications.
- How user's gonna deal with `screen brightness`, `volume`, How user's gonna take `screenshots`. **A script for each of those tasks**, not only doing the work but displaying the `information` also.
- That's it, Right... **`NO!`**
- Then write `READMEs`, `Guides` for you on how to use that WM.
- Telling you how you can `setup` those things on your computer, on `other distributions`.
- Telling you what the` keybindings` are, how to use the `mouse or touchpad`.
- Recording [**`Videos`**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKams_O4O37OL33r9S8hQQQ/videos) (_multiple times for a perfect video_), `multiple videos`, each of them demonstrating all features of that WM.
- Uploading them on [**Youtube**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKams_O4O37OL33r9S8hQQQ).
- Well, that's enough work. All Done... **`NO!`**
- Dealing with **your issues**, Telling you the same thing again and again even though it's mentioned on README.
- `Guide` you how to achieve a thing on that WM.

Yeah... Imagine the work here. And to be honest even though i'm putting a `price` here, ***`It doesn't even justify the work and effort`***.

Assume working for **15USD an hour** (lowest) for **8 hours** (regular 9to5 job). And if it takes **`7 days`** to configure a WM (_trust me it takes that much time when you do everything from scratch_), You should be getting **`15x8x7 = 840 USD`**. I put a **5USD tag** on each WM with a **`total 100 purchases`**. Even though if **100** people purchase it, I still get **500 USD** (**414 USD** actually after charges). Dude I'm not getting half of the actual work I've done.

Still people teaches me `ETHICS`, Yeah... **`FUCK ETHICS`**.

**FOSS** doesn't mean `FREE OF COST`. It means **`Freedom`** to choose. So you're free to choose either my stuff or other stuff.

> **`Yes, I'm a FOSS developer and I charge for my time, work and efforts. That's it.`**

### I understand now, what else can you do for me?

- I can create **`A fully customized Linux distribution`** for you that is `tailored` according to you, your `needs` and `workflow`. To be assured about the **quality of work**, Check [Archcraft](https://archcraft.io/).
- I can set up any **`Window manager`**, **`wayland compositor`**, **`Desktop Environment`** for you, according to your taste.
- I can create any kind of `rice / theme` (desktop setup) for you, Just show the concept, screenshot and I'll do it `from scratch`.
